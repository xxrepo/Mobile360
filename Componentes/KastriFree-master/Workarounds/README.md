# KastriFree Workarounds

The files in this folder contain instructions for *potential* workarounds for issues with Delphi.

Typically the files will refer to the report number in the Quality Portal:

  https://quality.embarcadero.com

e.g. RSP-19525.txt refers to:

  https://quality.embarcadero.com/browse/RSP-19525

Each file will have a link to the report in it, plus instructions on how to apply the workaround.

For workarounds that have a .patch file, please use the Patch utility from here:

  http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/patch.htm
  
To apply a patch, firstly *copy the file to be patched*, and use the Patch command thus (for example):

  C:\Utils\Patch C:\Copied\FMX.VirtualKeyboard.Android.pas < FMX.VirtualKeyboard.Android.10.2.2.patch

***USE THESE WORKAROUNDS AT YOUR OWN RISK - NO LIABILITY WILL BE ACCEPTED***

However, please report any issues to:
